# About Clouflare 

Before startinf this projesct we were not fimilar with CloudFlare pages. So for planty of developers it might be xtrange but we have never user CF for hosting. And when we tried it with HUGO it was amazing experience. 
In couple clicks and terminal commands you are able to have hosted site arount 10 min. 

Let's speak about CloudFlare pages. The majour reasons why we choosen it : 

1. Fastest network: run your site on the Cloudflare edge, milliseconds from end users – up to 115% faster than competing platforms.
2. Incredibly scalable: with one of the world’s largest networks, Cloudflare can absorb traffic from the most visited sites.
3. Always secure: SSL works out of the box, so you never have to worry about provisioning certificates.
4. Stay ahead of the curve: support for the latest web standards with HTTP/3, QUIC, image compression out of the box, and more.

In addition we have had good experience with deploynebt and with ths servicing of project. SSL is available by default . Everything that you need is direct your domain to CloudFlare ( In our case the domain provider is Godaddy)
