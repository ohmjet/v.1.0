# Intro

The main reason we decided to publish this repo is that we want to show you how simple it is to build your website from scratch without technical knowledge.

The main goal for site was to create if from scratch and host it for free.  You can see here all steps from domain registration to static files hosting. 

# About HUGO 

For our own website https://ohmjet.com our team choosen HUGO as a main framework and here couple reason why: 

1. Price. It is free
2. Google site speed result. It is faster than outher frameworks.
3. Technical knowleges. It doesn't need any technical skills. The first steps were done without needing to write code.
4. Time to market. As usual it takes a lot of time to develop site from the scratch. In a case of Hugo it took not more than 1 day from domain registration to hosting your files
5. Massive developers community. As next plan after design the final UI/UX for website we plan work with developers from community and don't plan to have our own.
6. SEO. It has a lot of components and facilities to be optimized for organic marketing.

# About Clouflare 

Before starting this projesct we were not fimilar with CloudFlare pages. So for planty of developers it might be xtrange but we have never user CF for hosting. And when we tried it with HUGO it was amazing experience. 
In couple clicks and terminal commands you are able to have hosted site arount 10 min. 

Let's speak about CloudFlare pages. The majour reasons why we choosen it : 

1. Fastest network: run your site on the Cloudflare edge, milliseconds from end users – up to 115% faster than competing platforms.
2. Incredibly scalable: with one of the world’s largest networks, Cloudflare can absorb traffic from the most visited sites.
3. Always secure: SSL works out of the box, so you never have to worry about provisioning certificates.
4. Stay ahead of the curve: support for the latest web standards with HTTP/3, QUIC, image compression out of the box, and more.

In addition we have had good experience with deploynebt and with ths servicing of project. SSL is available by default . Everything that you need is direct your domain to CloudFlare ( In our case the domain provider is Godaddy) 

# About Godaddy 

As usual for domain registration our team ueses Goddady. Godaddy is the bigest one provider with the a lot of discount. 
We registered our own domain https://ohmjet.com for 5$ and as you know each website starts from domain name. 
It could be the first step in a buisness establishing. For us it works. Everytime when we start buisness from Brand Name, so your domain, as usual, is equal to the business name.
